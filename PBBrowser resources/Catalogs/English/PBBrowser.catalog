SearchLimitsTitle      = Bypassing search limits.
SearchLimitsEx         = PBBrowser is designed to work on program code. By default, it only searches for whole words located in the actual code, i.e., outside of string literals and outside of comments.%newline%In some cases, however, it is possible to bypass these limits:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%You can search for an entire string by typing ''Complete string'' (with opening and closing quotes) in the ''Expression:'' field.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%You can search for an expression starting with something by entering that something in the ''Expression:'' field. The first expression found that starts with that something will then be considered as the one you wanted to search for. However, if you type the letter 'A' and one of your variables is named 'A', you will only get results for 'A'.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%You can search for a comment starting with a specific word or series of words: type ; Start of comment (with the semicolon at the beginning), in the ''Expression:'' field and you will find all comments starting with ''Start of comment''.

CreateToolsTitle      = Create your own tools in PBBrowser.
CreateToolsEx         = Since PBBrowser is designed for programmers, it wouldn't be surprising if you wanted to dive into its code, which is freely downloadable. But with more than two hundred procedures to analyze, the task might seem daunting, even though its code is abundantly commented (in english only, unfortunately for non-english-speaking programmers, but Google Translate should be able to help you).%newline%If you're satisfied with its current functionality and only want to add features by taking advantage of some of its existing procedures, you can add functions without touching the existing ones.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%1-Execute the ''Retrieve PBBrowser source code'' command found in the list at the bottom left of this window.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%2-Open the ''PBBrowser_CustomTools.pb'' file in ''PBBrowser resources/Source Codes''. You will find all the necessary explanations to integrate one of your procedures into the "Tools" menu, located at the bottom left of this window..%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%3-Recompile the application with PureBasic.

MainFileTitle         = Main file and included files
MainFileEx            = PBBrowser is primarily designed to be called from the PureBasic editor. When this happens, PBBrowser will naturally examine the code of the file from which the call originated, but it will also extend its examination to all files it considers 'related' to this file:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%If the user has opened a main file containing 'IncludeFile' or 'XIncludeFile' references, the included files will be added to the list of files to be examined.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%If the examined file has been set in the PureBasic editor using the 'Compiler Options' menu and designated as being linked to a ''Main file'', then this ''Main file'' becomes PBBrowser's Main file, and all files it declares as 'IncludeFile' or 'XIncludeFile' are added to the list of files to be examined.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%In summary, the list of files will be completed either upstream or downstream of the examined file, based on the indications PBBrowser can extract.

ChangeMainFileTitle    = Change main file
ChangeMainFileEx       = The 'Change' button on the main window allows you to change the main file. When you do this, PBBrowser clears all the information it has gathered from its previous examination and starts a complete exploration of the files identified as being related to the new main file. %newline%However, if the ''new'' file you choose was already in the previous list of files, the operation will produce no changes.

SearchModTitle         = PBBrowser search modes
SearchModEx            = PBBrowser searches within the code of your files in three possible ways:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%1- The ''Found in...'' panel displays the results of a direct search within the code. The expression is searched for, and then the surrounding code is explored to determine the context in which the expression was found (inside a procedure or macro, for example). This search mode allows you to display (almost) immediate results for a given expression.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%2- As soon as PBBrowser starts, a systematic exploration of the files linked to the main file begins, to create an exhaustive list of all the 'elements' that compose the code. Among these elements are, for example, procedures, macros, structures, constants, etc. This first code exploration is generally quite fast (less than half a second, even for large code) and provides the user with an overview of what makes up their code.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%3- Once the exploration of the previous mode (2-) is completed, PBBrowser begins an in-depth exploration to determine which elements are used (or not) by the main file. In the case of a large or very large project (over 200 KB), this exploration can take several seconds. It starts by examining all the code located outside procedures and macros. The procedures called by the defined code are considered 'used'. They are then themselves examined to see which procedures and macros they call, and so on. Once the deep exploration is complete, the names of unused elements are colored gray in all windows.

SearchLaunchTitle         = Launch a search in PBBrowser
SearchLaunchEx            = There are four ways to launch a search in the code of your files:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%1- From the PureBasic editor, and if PBBrowser has been installed in the editor's tools, simply click or double-click on any word, then go to the ''Tools / PBBrowser'' menu, or use the keyboard shortcut for PBBrowser (CTRL + Q, if you've kept the default shortcut). This will automatically launch PBBrowser if it is not already open, and a search for the chosen word will be immediately performed. If PBBrowser is already running, the search will be done directly.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%2- Once PBBrowser is launched, and a main file has been designated, you can enter an expression in the 'Expression' field, then click 'Search' or press the 'Return' key.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%3- When you click on an underlined expression, a search is immediately launched with that expression.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%4- If you want to search for an expression that appears in one of PBBrowser's panels but is not underlined, double-click on the expression, then press CTRL + Q on the keyboard.

NavigationTitle         = Navigation in PBBrowser
NavigationEx            = When you click on an underlined expression in one of PBBrowser's windows, it can produce several effects depending on the context:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%From the ''File'' panel, a click will open the chosen file in the PureBasic editor.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%From the ''Lists'' panel, a left-click on an element's name will open that element in the ''Details'' panel. A right-click on the element will open it in the ''Found in...'' panel.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%From the ''Details'' panel, clicking on a filename will open the file in the PureBasic editor; a left-click on an element's name will open that element in the ''Details'' panel; A right-click on the element will open it in the ''Found in...'' panel; Clicking on a PureBasic keyword (such as 'If' or 'EndIf') will initiate a web search for explanations about the keyword; Clicking on the name of a native function (such as 'FindString' or 'MessageRequester') will open the PureBasic help file related to that function.%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%From the ''Found in...'' panel, clicking on a line number in parentheses will position the PureBasic editor on the corresponding line number; Clicking on a filename will open the file in the PureBasic editor; A left-click on an element's name will open that element in the ''Details'' panel; A right-click on the element will open it in the ''Found in...'' panel.%newline%Also, remember that the 'Tab' key or the 'SHIFT' + 'TAB' combination allows you to switch between panels, and the '<<' and '>>' keys allow you, depending on the case, to move from one page to another or from one panel to another.

InstallPBBrowserTitle  = Install PBBrowser in PureBasic tools
InstallPBBrowserEx     = By clicking 'Run', you will install PBBrowser in your PureBasic editors' tools.%newline%If PBBrowser is already installed in the tools, this command will have no effect.%newline%Remember that the PureBasic editor must be restarted for the parameter changes to take effect.

UninstallPBBrowserTitle  = Uninstall PBBrowser from PureBasic tools
UninstallPBBrowserEx     = By clicking 'Run', you will uninstall PBBrowser from your PureBasic editors' tools.%newline%This command does not remove PBBrowser from your disk. You will need to delete it manually.%newline%Remember that the PureBasic editor must be restarted for the parameter changes to take effect.

UpdateFunctionsTitle   = Update native functions
UpdateFunctionsEx      = To color code elements, PBBrowser lists the native functions of PureBasic by scanning the 'PureBasic.chm' help file provided with each version of PureBasic.%newline%By clicking 'Run', you update this list from the most recent version of PureBasic installed on your computer. By default, this version was used to establish the current list. However, if you have just installed a newer version of PureBasic, it might be helpful to update it. In this case, click 'Run'.

UpdatePBExeTitle      = Select the version of PureBasic.exe
UpdatePBExeEx         = When you click on a file or procedure name, PBBrowser attempts to open it by sending a message to the PureBasic editor.%newline%If you have multiple versions of PureBasic installed, you may prefer to use one in particular. However, note that if PBBrowser was launched from an editor using the 'Tools' menu or a keyboard shortcut, it will always use that version of the editor until it is called by another version. Thus, if you are working with several versions of PureBasic at the same time, PBBrowser will always respond to the version that initiated a dialogue with it. You can still click 'Run' to set your preference.

ProcVariablesTitle     = Check procedure declarations
ProcVariablesEx        = This function scans the code of all procedures in the file currently selected as ''Source file'', as well as all its ''Included'' files.%newline%When it detects the use of variables that are not 'Global' or 'Shared' and that are not declared as 'Static' or 'Protected', this function adds a 'Protected' statement followed by the list of the relevant variables.%newline%This provides an overview of the use of variables in each procedure, and also prevents a local variable from accidentally sharing its content with another procedure or the main program if its name is later used to name a global variable.

CreateUpdateProjectTitle = Create or update a PureBasic 'project'
CreateUpdateProjectEx    = As you can do manually using the 'Project' menu of the PureBasic editor, this function creates or updates a PureBasic project from the list of files compiled by PBBrowser. Projects allow you to:%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%Maintain a complete list of files required for your programs to function%nonbreakingspace%;%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%Enable PureBasic editor auto-completion for procedure, variable, and constant names not included in your main file%nonbreakingspace%;%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%Add comments, version numbers, etc., to describe your project%nonbreakingspace%;%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%Load in one go the code files relevant to a specific phase of development%nonbreakingspace%;%newline%•%nonbreakingspace%etc.%newline%%newline%If the project already exists, this function will simply add files not yet listed but referenced by 'Include', 'XInclude', or 'IncludeBinary' statements.%newline%%newline%If the project does not exist yet, this function will create it and group all files referenced in the code. You can then adjust the created project information using the 'Project' menu of the PureBasic editor, as you would for any other project.
